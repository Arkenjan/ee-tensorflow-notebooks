# Contributing

This is a community driven repository to provide examples using TensorFlow with Earth Engine. Contributions are welcome and 
encouraged for this community driven repository. All credit will be given to contributors work.

There are many ways one may contribute:

## Types of Contributions

### Provide Examples

The goal of this repo is to provide the Earth Engine community with examples of Deep Learning workflows using TensorFlow with
the Earth Engine platform. Please follow these guidelines for examples:

 1. Example is provided as a notebook (preferablly a [Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/)
that links to GitHub)
 2. All data needed for the example is shared or available publically via Earth Engine, Cloud Storage, or this repo
 3. Explanation of what is happening above (markdown text) and in (inline comments)  non-intuitive code blocks is provided
 4. Any additional information (i.e. TF version or paper) is provided so users can understand what is happening


### Bug Reports

Report bugs at https://github.com/gee-community/ee-tensorflow-notebooks/issues

If you are reporting a bug, please include:
 - Any details about your setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting. (Especially if running locally)
 - Detailed steps to reproduce the bug

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" is open to whoever wants to help fix/debug.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to create an issue at https://github.com/gee-community/ee-tensorflow-notebooks/issues.

If you are proposing an example:

 - Explain in detail how it would work.
 - Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
 - Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that *your* contributions are welcome and appreciated



## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

 1. Test the notebook can run successfully from start with no errors
 2. All data needed (on Earth Engine or otherwise) is available to users - meaning publically available
 3. The explanation makes sense - good tip is have a friend that has never seen it run through the example


## Get Started!
Ready to contribute? Here's a simple walkthrough on how to add your TF example:

 1. Create your EE+TF Example
 2. Fork the ee-tensorflow-notebooks repo on GitHub
 3. Save your Colab Notebook to your GitHub repo (or commit your local notebook to the repo)
 4. Check that your notebook satisfies the requirements above and test.
 5. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website!

Once a pull request is submitted one of the contributors will review the notebook for content and scope then  merge the request!
